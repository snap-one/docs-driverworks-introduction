## Driver Development Templates

A driver development template is essentially a Control4 device driver. However, the contents of the driver resemble more of a framework. Your job, as a driver developer, is to fill in the framework that we have provided to produce a finished device driver. Control4 currently provides templates for the following Proxies:

- AV Switch
- Blind
- Doorstation
- DVD
- Generic Proxy
- IP Camera
- Lock
- Pool
