# The Role of Director

Director is the software platform that runs on all Control4 controllers. It communicates with device drivers in a manner that enforces a standardized API which hides the complexity of a huge array of different systems and protocols. It also uses that communication to serve up various user interfaces that are displayed on a wide variety of navigation devices.
